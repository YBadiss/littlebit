A **finite field** is a finite set of numbers and two operations **+** (addition) and **∙** (multiplication), such that:

1. **Closure:** if `a` and `b` are in the set, `a + b` and `a ∙ b` are also in the set.
2. **Additive identity:** 0 exists and has the property `a + 0 = a`.
3. **Multiplicative identity:** 1 exists and has the property `a ∙ 1 = a`.
4. **Additive inverse:** if `a` is in the set, `-a` is also in the set, where `a + (-a) = 0`.
5. **Multiplicative inverse:** if `a` is in the set, `a⁻¹` is also in the set, where `a ∙ a⁻¹ = 1`.

**Note:** fields must have an order that is a power of a prime.
